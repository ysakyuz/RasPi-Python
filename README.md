HI.

This project involves reading and displaying data from an air quality sensor accessed via a shared network 
using a Raspberry Pi, with the help of Python. The setup of materials and preparation of the necessary 
environment is also included, requiring approximately four hours of work. You can easily continue your 
projects, such as displaying results on the web or integrating them into applications, using this 
infrastructure. (readme.pdf)

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. 

Thank you...
